Notice to All Patients of South Branch Family Practice:

The following is an important notice of changes to the health insurance billing rules and regulations and may affect your familyâ€™s coverage.  Please read this whole section carefully.

It is important for all patients covered under all insurance plans know and understand what their insurance companies do or do not cover.  There are, however, so many different insurance plans that it is not possible for us to know the specific details of each individual plan.

  When you know what your insurance company will or will not pay for, we can provide you with efficient and better preventive care.

  It is your insurance company, not your doctor, making the decisions on what will or will not be paid for.   MOST of the things your doctor recommends will be covered, but if your particular plan does not cover the treatment, the drug, or the screening they will not pay the bill and the charge will go toward your deductible.

What to expect from the Annual Physical Exam:

BMI/Vitals
Family/Personal History
Obesity screening
Depression screening
Hearing Screening
Vision Screening
Osteoporosis Screening
Alcohol Screening
Smoking  review
Prostrate/Breast and Pap Screening
Asthma screening ( if applicable )
EKG (if applicable)
These are the procedures and screenings needed to make sure you are getting the best preventive care possible.

A physical is defined as a wellness exam only.
Discussions of Abnormal blood-work, changes of medication, discussions of abnormal findings of tests, and counseling of any kind are not part of the physical exam. These are considered separate visits by the insurance companies.   It is required that we bill for these services separately.   If we perform any of these tasks during the Annual Physical Exam, this may or may not result in your insurance company requiring us to charge you a co-pay or fee for that part of the visit. 

You always have the option of scheduling a separate office visit to have these discussions on a day separate from your physical; we prefer to do this at the same time, however, to save you a trip.
Phone Consultations:

With the new billing regulations, phone consultations that consist of the prescribing of medication, counseling, or a diagnosis will be charged to your insurance companies and MAY result in you owing a co-pay of up to, but not exceeding, $15.00.

 - Any phone call that results in an office visit will NOT be charged twice; you will only be charged for the office visit when you come in.
