Attention Medicare Patients:

What to expect from the Annual Physical Exam:

BMI/Vitals
Family/Personal History
Obesity screening
Depression screening
Hearing Screening
Vision Screening
Osteoporosis Screening
Alcohol Screening
Smoking  review
Prostrate/Breast and Pap Screening
Asthma screening ( if applicable )
EKG (if applicable)
These are the procedures and screenings needed to make sure you are getting the best preventive care possible.
If your insurance company does not cover one or more of these screenings/procedures, you will be given the chance to opt out of them at the beginning of your office visit. You will be given an ABN form (Advance Beneficiary Notice of Non-coverage).  
When you fill these out, you can opt out of the procedure(s) that may not be covered. You should always consult with your doctor before opting out of these important preventative procedures.

*As of January 2013,  Medicare does NOT cover the Hearing screening during the annual physical.
