<h1>As a Primary Care Facility, we are proud to serve all members of your family, from infants to the elderly.</h1>

<p>South Branch Family Practice is the family care practice of Julie Ann Juliano, M.D. and Ruby Halper-Erkkila, M.D., both of whom are experienced family health physicians serving the Branchburg and greater New Jersey area.  The focus of our practice is to provide your family with complete healthcare services.  We offer routine and preventative care services, including: physical exams and immunizations, illness and injury treatment, chronic disease management and specialist referrals.
 We are two separate practices under one roof.  This union affords you the advantage of continuity of care; one doctor that knows you and your family personally as well as coverage in the same location when your primary doctor is unavailable.  New and existing patients must call the phone number corresponding to the physician they seek regarding appointments.</p>
